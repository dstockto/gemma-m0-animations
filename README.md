# Gemma M0 Animations

This is a little animation library with an included animation
that runs on Circuit Python on the Gemma M0 microchip. The chip
should be connected to an 8x8 LED board (details later).

The included animation is a Beer Geeks animation showing a mug
of beer and the words Beer Geeks animated. The animations are built 
from "frames" of 8 integers per frame, with each integer representing 8 
bits of a row.
